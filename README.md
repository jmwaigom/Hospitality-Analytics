### Table of Contents
### Project Overview
ORUS is a company that owns and operates seven hotel brands in four states in the United States, namely: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. The General Manager (GM)
of ORUS wants a high level overview of how the brands have been performing across the locations. He wants to know the performance of the brands in terms of revenue, booking volume,
occupancy and customer rating in the months of May, June and July of 2022. He has outsourced the job to your private data consultancy company and you have been assigned with building 
a dashboard and creating a summary report to convey key insights on the overall performance of the company

### Objectives
Display the following on the dashboard
1. KPIs: Revenue generated and realized, total bookings, average occupancy, average customer rating and rate of successful bookings
2. Revenue by hotel and their pro-rata share
3. Average occupancy and customer rating by hotel
4. Proportion of total bookings and revenue that's being generated through each booking platform
5. Pro-rata share of revenue by room class in each hotel

### Key Insights
Overall, ORUS Hotels generated 23.07M and realized 19.65M of revenue from it (about 85%). For the total realized revenue, NYC was the leading city totaling around 7.69M (39.1%) followed by Chicago 4.83M (24.6%), Boston 3.73M (19.0%) and LA 3.39M (17.3%). This seems to correlate to some extent with the number of hotels in each city. All 7 ORUS brands are present in NYC, all but ORUS seasons in Chicago and Boston, and 5 brands in LA (all but ORUS Exotica and ORUS Seasons)

Overall, ORUS Exotica was leading by 18.54%, followed by Orus Palace, 18.08% then ORUS City, 17.03%. The overall performance of ORUS Exotica appears to be heavily driven by its strong performance in NYC where it generated over 2.4M in realized revenue. This is the highest compared to any other hotel in either NYC or any leading hotel in the other 3 cities (ORUS Bay in Boston: 788K, ORUS City in Chicago: 959K, ORUS Palace in LA 1.04M). Strong performance of ORUS Exotica in NYC is significant, because despite being located in only 3 cities (all except LA), it still outperformed ORUS Palace and ORUS City (2nd and 3rd overall performers) which are located in all 4 cities. The strong performance of ORUS Exotica could be attributed to its significantly higher booking volume compared to other hotels in NYC. It totaled a whopping 13K bookings (30.7%) which is more than double of any other hotel in NYC and top booked hotels in any of the 3 other cities (see column chart below)

ORUS seasons was the least overall revenue contributor (3.93%) because it's located in NYC only compared to the rest of the hotels which are located in at least 3 cities each.
